# LIRI-NODE-APP

### Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages crucial for this assignment.

   * [Twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
   
   * [Spotify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)
   
   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

     * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com).

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
     


1. Initialize a `package.json` file at your project root by running `npm init`. Be sure to save all of the npm packages you'll be using to this file. If you fail to initialize a `package.json` file and save your dependencies to it, it will be troublesome, and at times almost impossible to run this code.

2. .gitignore file is telling git not to track next files, and thus they won't be committed to Github.

```
node_modules
.DS_Store
.env
```

3. File named `.env` is replacing the values with your API keys (no quotes) once you have them:

```js
# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

# Twitter API keys

TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=your-twitter-consumer-key
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-twitter-consumer-secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY=your-access-token-key
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-twitter-access-token-secret

```

* This file will be used by the `dotenv` package to set what are known as environment variables to the global `process.env` object in node. These are values that are meant to be specific to the computer that node is running on, and since we are gitignoring this file, they won't be pushed to github &mdash; keeping our API key information private.

* If you want to clone my app from github and run it yourself, you would need to supply your own `.env` file for it to work.

* You should then be able to access your keys information like so

  ```js
  var spotify = new Spotify(keys.spotify);
  var client = new Twitter(keys.twitter);
  ```

4. liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

    * `my-tweets`

    * `spotify-this-song`

    * `movie-this`

    * `do-what-it-says`

### What Each Command Should Do

1. `node liri.js my-tweets`

   * This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
     
     * Artist(s)
     
     * The song's name
     
     * A preview link of the song from Spotify
     
     * The album that the song is from

   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.
   
   * You will utilize the [node-spotify-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api) package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.
   
   * Like the Twitter API, the Spotify API requires you sign up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. You can follow these steps in order to generate a **client id** and **client secret**:

3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
     ```

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
     
   * Request package is retrieving data from the OMDB API. Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key.

4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
   
   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
     
     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
     
     * Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.

### BONUS

* In addition to logging the data to your terminal/bash window, the data will be output to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

* Each successful command you run will be appended to the `log.txt` file.
